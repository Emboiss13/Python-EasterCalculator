# Python Blog and Easter Date Calculator

## Why do I have a branding folder? 

I decided to take this project further and create a case study version of it. 

My main focus was to design a simple blog post website for a fictitious company called "Letra Studio", as part of their "Web development package", I offered them a free branding design so that they could implement in all areas of their business. 

This was mainly to help me have a clear idea of what the mood, fonts and brand were going to be like when creating my website. 

This was my first ever website, using cgi-bin, CSS, HTML and python. I created a website to learn about python as a programming language and added an easter date calculator.
