# Python Blog and Easter Date Calculator

This was my first ever website, using cgi-bin, CSS, HTML and Python. I created a website to learn about Python as a programming language and added an easter date calculator. 

## Why do I have a branding folder? 

I decided to take this project further and create a case study version of it. 

My main focus was to design a simple blog post website for a fictitious company called "Letra Studio", as part of their "Web development package", I offered them a free branding design so that they could implement in all areas of their business. 

This was mainly to help me have a clear idea of what the mood, fonts and brand were going to be like when creating my website. 

## Features
Calculates the date of Easter based on the input year.
Provides two output formats: numeric and verbose.
Outputs HTML content for integration with web applications.

### CGI Form Handling
The script uses the CGI module to handle form data submitted through an HTML form. The following fields are expected:

- year: The input year for which the Easter date is to be calculated.
- username: The username of the user making the calculation.
- format: The desired output format ('numerically', 'verbose', or any other value for both formats).

### Easter Calculation Functions
The script contains two functions for Easter date calculation:

- Easternum(y): Returns the Easter date in numeric format.
- Eastermonth(y): Returns the Easter date in verbose format.

### HTML Output
The HTML output is generated based on the selected output format. The script includes headers, stylesheets, and a message displaying the calculated Easter date.
