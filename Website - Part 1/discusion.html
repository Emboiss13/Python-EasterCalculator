            <br></br>
              <div class="content">
                <p>We can start by saying that Python is arguably the most popular and fastest- developing programming language out there. Boasting a 27% year over year growth rate, Python has quickly become the preferred language of programmers, serving trending applications such as machine learning and data science [11].</p>
                <br></br>
                <h2>• Why is Python in demand compared to other languages?</h2>
                <br></br>
                <p>Unlike C++ and Java, the syntax for navigating, compiling, and solving problems is not overly complicated. Python uses English keywords, making it simple, readable, and maintainable. It integrates easily with other programming languages and supports functional, structural, and object-oriented programming (OOP).</p>
                <br></br>
                <h2>• Not to mention a thriving ecosystem:</h2>
                <br></br>
                <p>Open-source libraries, frameworks, and a community of experts make every problem temporary. The language's versatility also speaks for Python. Sometimes referred to as the "Swiss Army knife" of programming, Python isn't tied to just one domain, but can support many domains such as data analysis, web applications, games, and automation. Many of today's major technology platforms utilize Python.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Instagram, YouTube, Dropbox, Spotify, Reddit, Pinterest, Instacart and more. Netflix's ability to predict what content users will be interested in is based on Python. 21% of Facebook's infrastructure is made of Python. Some of Google's early engineers are said to have said, "Python where you can, C++ where you need to."</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>With today's explosive trends towards smart devices, connectivity, and artificial intelligence, the need for Python experts is also exploding. In 2018, LinkedIn reported that the company was short for more than 150,000 experts in data science, software development, and machine. </p>
                <br></br>
                <h2>• Demand for python is increasing</h2>
                <br></br>
                <p>Today, demand continues to outstrip supply, making Python developers one of the highest paid tech jobs. Additionally, for entrepreneurs and anyone wanting to learn to code, Python continues to be a great skill to learn. It is considered the best and most versatile beginner's language due to its simple, easy-to-understand structure and wide range of applications.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Familiarity with Python can advance (or start) many professionals' careers. Python is recognized as one of the most important languages to learn and has the added advantage of being compatible with existing languages, which is why every programmer or analyst is desperate to add it to their resume. It's a skill anyone in the tech industry should be able to have.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Python has become of such impact that it is now being taught at most universities. When it comes to coding jobs, Python is the programming language Brits most intend to learn, followed by SQL.  This happens because both universities and self-taught developers know that python is a great language to add into ones portfolio for applying to work at any company [12]. </p>
                <br></br>
                <h3>Python will help freshers find jobs quickly... </h2>

                <q><cite="https://www.netimperative.com/2020/08/26/the-most-in-demand-programming-languages-in-the-uk/">From an analysis of the technical jobs currently available across Europe, software and systems engineers appear to be in great demand.</q>
                <p class="reference"> Netimperative, August 26, 2020</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Software engineering is currently the most sought-after technical job in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Ireland, Netherlands, and Norway. The same applies to systems engineering in Finland, France, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the UK.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Interestingly, Poland and Russia have the most job openings for Java developers specializing in programming. Elsewhere, AI Engineering (Italy and Romania) and Data Engineering (Denmark and Luxembourg) are the technology positions that offer the highest number of employment opportunities for qualified candidates.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>All these jobs will be filed out by relatively unexperienced programmers, and the language that has proven to be easy for developers to learn is python. Some say Python is intuitive as compared to other programming languages. While others believe, it is due to the number of libraries Python offers that makes it suitable for all developers to use [13].</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Within the past years, Python has managed to grow its community worldwide. You can find multiple platforms and forums where machine learning solutions are shared. For every problem, you’ve faced you’ll always find there’s already someone who has been through with the same problem. Thus, it is easy to find solutions and guidance through this community.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Python also has the advantage of being platform independent, this simply means that a programming language or framework allows a developer to implement something in one machine learning and use the same in another without further modification. The best thing about Python is that it is a platform independent language supported by several other platforms such as Windows, macOS and Linux. Meaning that a Python code itself can create self-contained programs that run on most operating systems without requiring a Python interpreter.</p>
                <br></br>
                <h2>• Conclusion: </h2>
                <br></br>
                <p>Python’s power and ease of use has catapulted it to become one of the core languages to provide machine learning solutions. As demand for technological jobs rises there is a linear correlation between the rise in programmers learning to use python. Not only because of the advantages in speedy learning and simplicity python has to offer, but also, because companies in general like standardizing work environments. Meaning that if internal processes within a company are done in the same language, the business can thrive as everyone can understand each other better. </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Companies are absolutely relying on python to do this, the same way (to put things into perspective) the globalized world has relied on English to become the international language that boosts international relationships and economies. The same thing happens in the tech industry, there is base of communication that helps everyone be on the same page, and python has been indirectly given this role. Hence, why learning it is so important, as it has impacted the course of developing technological projects worldwide. </p>
