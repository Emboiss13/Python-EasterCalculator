                <p>Although python is well known for its <strong>flexibility and beginner friendly usage</strong>, many people question whether it <strong>is still a good language to learn</strong> with the long term in mind. This article will hopefully help solve that question and offer a perspective towards the programming languages of the future. </p>

                <p>These are just a few examples of companies, large and small, using Python around the world. Given the huge community of developers and engineers surrounding Python, it's safe to say that people in all industries and disciplines use the language for both professional and recreational purposes.</p>
                <br></br>
                <h2>• Where is python currently standing? </h2>
                <br></br>
                <p>On October 4, 2021, Python 3.10.0 was released. The new version offers several features and optimizations compared with the 3.9 release. According to the Python website, they include syntax features, library features, interpreter improvements, and typing features, along with some additional removals and restrictions. </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Python version 3.10.4 is the current stable release, the fourth maintenance release of Python 3.10, published on March 24, 2022. Among other additions and improvements, this version offers precise line numbers for debugging and other tools, explicit type aliases, parameter specification variables, and much more.</p>
                <br></br>
                <h2>• What is the future of python? </h2>
                <br></br>
                <p>Python is often in the news, and with good reason. Python's professional future also looks very promising. Over 40,000 jobs worldwide are reserved for experienced Python software developers [15]. Python still has some work to do, including the improvement of:</p>
                <br></br>
                  <ul>
                    <li><p>speed</p></li>
                    <li><p>compatibility with native environments</p></li>
                    <li><p>runtime errors</p></li>
                    <li><p>browser integrations</p></li>
                  </ul>
                <br></br>
                <p>If python manages to completely fix these issues, the language would be the top programming language out there. Currently, even with these minor flaws, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, making Python one of the most popular programming languages world-wide. Additionally, Python is used in data analytics, big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other innovative technologies. Its importance is expected to increase in the near future. Python can help brighten the future of software developers if they can function and use it properly. It also tops the list of the most used and popular programming languages in the world [16]. </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>It’s hard to stay in the positive side of this debate, considering that there are always rumours lingering in the air about once-popular programming languages losing their appeal. So, we can state facts because Python is most certainly not going away any time soon. For starters it has been around for decades, during which time it has grown in popularity and has become a staple of top companies around the world.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Also, python has proven to be implemented in many universities or colleges worldwide because of its easy-to-understand syntax and fast learning curve. Hence, this increases the number of people that know the language and promote its usage in start-up projects or in businesses once employed. </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Finally, machine learning and data science are growing and gaining attention. Python plays an important role in these areas. It will likely continue to be the language of choice for these key areas to help developers automate, scale, and improve their products.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>It's impossible to call Python completely future proof, but the language is definitely long-lived and will stand up to modern conditions. It's also a tool that will reliably keep organization on the stack for years, even decades.</p>
