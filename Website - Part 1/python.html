                <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented [1], high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built-in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together [2].</p>

                <br></br>
                <strong>‚Ä¢ Interpreted: </strong><p>This means that python, compared to compiled languages, doesn‚Äôt need to compile a program into machine instructions to run it [3]. The instructions are not directly executed by the target machine, instead, they are executed and read by another program [4].</p>

                <strong> ‚Ä¢	Object- oriented: </strong><p>Also abbreviated as OOP is a way of organizing software design around data or objects. This programming model focuses on data or objects instead of functions and logic. In this case, we can think of an object as a data field that has unique attributes and behaviours. This type of organization can be better for large, complex, and frequently updated projects, this includes manufacturing, design, and even mobile applications [5]. </p>

                <br></br>
                <strong> ‚Ä¢	High-level programming language: </strong><p>To better understand this we can start by explaining its opposite first; a low-level programming language must focus on communicating or explaining information to the machine itself. Hence, these are the parts of a coded system that are written in a more complex language. Since this communication is directly with the machine, the language used is almost incomprehensible to human logic (binary languages, et al). Hence, a high-level programming language has the main objective or purpose of solving a problem. This part of the code doesn‚Äôt have to worry about how the computer will interpret this information. This other part of the job is done by an interpreter, and we can communicate the same code with different levels of abstraction. These levels will specify different parts of the machine how it must execute or process them [6]. </p>

                <br></br>
                <strong> ‚Ä¢	Dynamic semantics:  </strong><p>Python uses dynamic semantics, meaning that its variables are dynamic objects. Essentially, it‚Äôs just another aspect of Python being a high-level language. In other words, Python lets you assign variables in a way that makes more sense to you than it does to the computer. It‚Äôs just another way that Python programming is intuitive. It also gives you the ability to do something like creating a list where different elements have different types like the list [1, 2, ‚Äúthree‚Äù, ‚Äúfour‚Äù]. Defining that in a language like C would be a nightmare, but in Python, that‚Äôs all there is to it [7]. </p>

                <h2>Some history</h2>
                <br></br>

                <strong> ‚Ä¢	Summary: </strong><p>Python was created by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL. It was first released on February 20, 1991.</p>

                <br></br>
                <strong> ‚Ä¢	Full story: </strong><p>We will start this journey by going back in time to the late 1980s, history was about to be written. Guido Van Rossum began doing its application-based work in December of 1989 at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) which is situated in the Netherlands. The ‚Äúpython project‚Äù started as a hobby to keep Rossum occupied during Christmas. The programming language in which Python is said to have succeeded is ABC Programming Language. Rossum had already helped to create ABC earlier in his career and he had seen some issues with it but liked most of the features [8]. </p>

                <br></br>
                <p>After that, what he did was very clever. He took the syntax of ABC, and some of its good features, he fixed the parts that he didn‚Äôt like and finally he created a good scripting language that had removed all the flaws in ABC. The inspiration for the name came from BBC‚Äôs TV Show ‚Äì ‚ÄòMonty Python‚Äôs Flying Circus‚Äô, as he was a big fan of the TV show and, he wanted a short, unique, and slightly mysterious name for his invention. That‚Äôs how the name Python was invented.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Rossum was the ‚ÄúBenevolent dictator for life‚Äù (BDFL) until he stepped down from the position as the leader on 12th July 2018. For quite some time he used to work for Google, but currently, he is working at Dropbox. </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>It‚Äôs important to mention that, rather than building all its functionality into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible via modules. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Python strives for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. In contrast to Perl's "there is more than one way to do it" motto, Python embraces a "there should be one‚Äîand preferably only one‚Äîobvious way to do it" philosophy. Alex Martelli, a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author, wrote: "To describe something as 'clever' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture."</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Python's developers strive to avoid premature optimization and reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity. </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>The language was finally released in 1991. When it was released, it used a lot fewer codes to express the concepts, when we compare it with Java, C++ & C. Its design philosophy was quite good too. Its main objective is to provide code readability and advanced developer productivity. When it was released, it had more than enough capability to provide classes with inheritance, several core data type exception handling, and functions. </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>One of the amazing features of Python is the fact that it is one person‚Äôs work. Usually, new programming languages are developed and published by large companies employing lots of professionals, and due to copyright rules, it is very hard to name any of the people involved in the project. Python is an exception.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Of course, Guido van Rossum did not develop and evolve all the Python components himself. The speed with which Python has spread around the world is a result of the continuous work of thousands (very often anonymous) programmers, testers, users (many of them aren‚Äôt IT specialists) and enthusiasts, but it must be said that the very first idea (the seed from which Python sprouted) came to one head ‚Äì Guido‚Äôs.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Python is maintained by the Python Software Foundation, a non-profit membership organization and a community devoted to developing, improving, expanding, and popularizing the Python language and its environment.</p>

                <h2>Python goals: </h2>
                <p><i>It‚Äôs very interesting to mention that certain python goals have been accomplished since its release in 1991[9].</i> </p>
                <br></br>
                <p><strong>In 1999, Guido van Rossum defined his goals for Python:</strong></p>
                <br></br>
                <ul>
                  <li>an easy and intuitive language just as powerful as those of the major competitors.</li>
                  <li>open source, so anyone can contribute to its development.</li>
                  <li>code that is as understandable as plain English.</li>
                  <li>suitable for everyday tasks, allowing for short development times.</li>
                </ul>

                <br></br>
                <p>20+ years later, all these intentions have been fulfilled. Some sources say that Python is the first-most popular programming language in the world, while others claim it‚Äôs the third.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Either way, it occupies the first position in the top ten of the TIOBE Programming Community and PYPL Popularity of Programming Language Indexes. (February 2022)</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Python isn‚Äôt a young language. It is mature and trustworthy. It‚Äôs not a one-hit wonder. It‚Äôs a bright star in the programming firmament, and time spent learning Python is a very good investment.</p>

                <h2>What can we use python for? </h2>
                <p>Here are 7 common and practical uses for python [10]: </p>
                <br></br>

                <ol>
                  <li><strong>AI & Machine Learning: </strong>Python is widely believed to be the programming language of choice for artificial intelligence (AI) due to its easy syntax and quick learning curve. When it comes to machine learning, according to Towards Data Science's idea sharing platform, 57% of his data scientists and machine learning developers use Python, with 33% making it a priority for development.</li>
                  <br></br>
                  <li><strong>Data Analytics: </strong>Many of the most popular data mining and analysis tools are written in Python. The result is a great tool for data science. Python's tools allow developers to separate important and relevant data. Big data not only helps retain customers, but it also helps businesses learn more about themselves. This kind of information can show you where your company's vulnerabilities lie so that you can act on them once they are identified.</li>
                  <br></br>
                  <li><strong>Web Development: </strong>Python as a backend language is surprisingly versatile. Its simplicity is the key factor here. The simple syntax is very similar to English, so the web developers who use this will save a lot of time and energy. Python is used for backend web development, including processing data, interacting with databases, and sending information between servers. Due to its widespread use, there are many Python frameworks available for backend development, such as Django.</li>
                  <br></br>
                  <li><strong>Search Engine Optimisation (SEO): </strong>Python helps SEO professionals automate tasks and help extract and analyse large amounts of data. You can use Python to analyse large datasets and identify website issues such as: B. Broken links. You can automate those solutions to minimize tedious work and eliminate human error.</li>
                  <br></br>
                  <li><strong>Blockchain: </strong>There are several popular languages for blockchain development, such as JavaScript, Java, and C++, but Python has proven to be a powerful language. Like any application, Python is highly recommended for blockchain development as it is highly flexible, functional and security-enhanced. </li>
                  <br></br>
                  <li><strong>Game Development: </strong>Although Python is not the top programming language used in game development, it is still very popular, especially for simple games. Also, the speed at which games can be created in Python is more flexible and the process is faster than other alternatives, so its simplicity makes it a great choice for prototyping and developing ideas in the gaming industry. It is mainly looked like an option that can be implemented if needed.</li>
                  <br></br>
                  <li><strong>Automation: </strong>Besides the previously mentioned uses for python, it can also be useful for anyone who interacts with big data sets, in or out of work. It can automate tedious tasks, including checking information in databases, data visualizations, financial analysis and much, much more. Learning Python will allow you to save time throughout your life, and it has the bonus of being one of the easier programming languages to learn!</li>
